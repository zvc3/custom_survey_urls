Customizing URLs for tracking purposes

SurveyMonkey (and other sites) allow you to create custom values that can track responses. However, survey monkey only creates the custom value placeholder, (ex: [custom_value]) it does not actually fill in the desired unique values.

This might be helpful if you are trying to customize a number of URLs from SurveyMonkey or elsewhere with unique values.

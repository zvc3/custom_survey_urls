Customizing URLs for tracking purposes

SurveyMonkey allows users to create custom values that may help track responses. However, SurveyMonkey only creates the custom value placeholder: [custom_value] 

It does not fill in the desired unique values. This might be helpful if you are trying to customize a number of URLs from SurveyMonkey or elsewhere with unique values.
